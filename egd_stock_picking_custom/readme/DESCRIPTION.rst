EGD Custody Report

The equipment loan report for partners and employees has been implemented.

When an employee requests equipment, the report includes the information contained therein, such as the requester's details and information about the requested equipment.

For material loans to partners, it is necessary to specify the employee responsible for the custody, as they will also be responsible for delivering the materials. Consequently, the report includes information about the individual responsible for delivering the materials to the partner and details of the products delivered.

The report is accessible via the 'Print' button with the label 'EGD Custody.' After selecting this option, the report will be printed with the data contained in the picking.
