Description
===========

This module implements the equipment loan report functionality for both partners and employees.

When an employee requests equipment, the report captures essential details, including the requester's information and the specifics of the requested equipment.

In cases of material loans to partners, it's necessary to designate the responsible employee for custody, as they will also handle the material delivery. As a result, the report contains information about the individual responsible for delivering materials to the partner, along with details of the delivered products.

To access this report, simply click the 'Print' button labeled 'EGD Custody.' Once selected, the report will be generated with the data from the picking process.
